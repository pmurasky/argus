# Testing Strategy

## Core Rule
Test at the lowest layer that gives you confidence. More unit tests than integration tests;
more integration tests than E2E tests. Inverting this pyramid produces a slow, fragile suite.

## The Test Pyramid

        /\
       /E2E\       ← few, slow, fragile — critical journeys only
      /------\
     /Integr. \    ← moderate — only at system boundaries
    /----------\
   / Unit Tests \  ← many, fast, isolated — all business logic
  /--------------\

The pyramid shape is intentional: unit tests are cheap to write and run in milliseconds;
E2E tests are expensive, slow, and occasionally flaky. Inverting it is a common mistake
that teams pay for with hours of CI time and fragile suites.

## Unit Tests

**Use for:** Business logic, algorithms, transformations, domain rules — anything that can
be tested without external dependencies.
**Characteristics:** No I/O, no network, no database. Milliseconds per test. Deterministic.
**Coverage:** 80% minimum for changed code (see `tdd` pack).
**Rule:** If it can be tested without any external dependency, test it here.

## Integration Tests

**Use for:** Code that crosses a system boundary — database queries, external API calls,
file I/O, message queues, adapter implementations.
**Characteristics:** Slower than unit tests. Uses real infrastructure or a realistic substitute
(e.g., an in-memory database, a local test container, a fake HTTP server).
**Scope is narrow:** Test the integration point itself, not every code path that reaches it.
One integration test per repository method or adapter — not one per caller.
**Rule:** If the behavior depends on a real external system, test it here, not in unit tests.

## End-to-End Tests

**Use for:** The 2–3 critical user journeys that must never break regardless of internal changes.
**Characteristics:** Slow (seconds to minutes), occasionally flaky due to timing and environment,
expensive to maintain. Tests the whole deployed system.
**Rule:** If a unit or integration test can answer the question, use that instead. E2E tests
are a last resort, not a default.
**Anti-pattern:** Testing every feature E2E. This produces a suite that takes 20+ minutes to
run and breaks on every UI or API change.

## Test Doubles

Use the simplest double that makes the test work:

| Double | What it is | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Fake** | A working simplified implementation | Integration tests — in-memory DB, fake HTTP server |
| **Stub** | Returns canned values, no behavior | Unit tests — when you need a value from a collaborator |
| **Mock** | Verifies that specific calls were made | Unit tests — when the interaction itself is the assertion |

**Prefer fakes and stubs over mocks.** Mocks assert on HOW code works internally — they
break when you refactor, even when behavior is correct. Fakes and stubs assert on WHAT
the code produces — they survive refactoring. See the `dependency-injection` pack for how
constructor injection makes substitution easy without patching internals.

**Never patch internals to test.** If you need to monkey-patch a private method or module
internals to write a test, that is a signal to inject the dependency instead.

## Test Execution Tiers

| When | What runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Before every commit | Unit tests only | Fast, isolated — no reason to skip |
| Before push | Unit tests + integration tests | Catch boundary failures before teammates see them |
| CI pipeline | Unit + integration + E2E | Hard gate — failures block merge |

## Red Flags — Stop and Correct
- E2E test written for a feature that could be covered by a unit test
- Mock asserting on an internal private method call
- Integration test covering business logic (that belongs in unit tests)
- Unit test hitting a real database or network
- Test suite takes more than 5 minutes to run locally (pyramid is inverted)
