# Documentation Standards

## Docstring Requirements
- All public classes must have a one-line docstring describing their purpose
- All public methods and functions must have a one-line docstring
- All Click CLI commands must have a one-line docstring (used by `--help`)
- `__init__` methods are exempt — document the class instead
- Private methods (prefixed `_`) are exempt

## Docstring Style
- One sentence, imperative mood: "Load packs from the search path." not "Loads packs..."
- No restating the function name: `def load():` → not "Load the load."
- Fits on one line — if you need more, the function probably does too much

## Comment Discipline
- Write comments only when the WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a workaround,
  a subtle invariant, or behaviour that would surprise a reader
- Never explain WHAT the code does — well-named identifiers already do that
- Never reference the current task, ticket, or caller in a comment

## Red Flags — Stop and Correct
- Public class, method, or CLI command with no docstring
- Docstring that restates the function name or explains what the code does
- Comment that says what the code does rather than why
- Multi-line docstring on a function under 10 lines
