# Dependency Injection

## Core Rule
Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Inject all dependencies via constructor — never
instantiate collaborators inside a class body.

## Constructor Injection
- Accept dependencies as constructor parameters typed to abstract interfaces (Protocol / ABC)
- Never call `ConcreteClass()` inside a class body; receive it as a parameter instead
- Store injected dependencies as instance attributes; do not pass them through method chains

## Abstract Boundaries
- Define a Protocol or ABC for every dependency that has more than one conceivable implementation
- Application-layer classes depend only on those abstractions, never on concrete imports from
  infrastructure layers (databases, HTTP clients, file system adapters)

## Composition Root
- Wire concrete implementations to abstractions in exactly one place: the entry point (CLI, app
  factory, `main()`)
- Test code is the only other place that substitutes implementations

## Red Flags — Stop and Correct
- `ConcreteClass()` instantiated inside a class body
- `import` of a concrete infrastructure class inside a domain or application module
- Method that accepts a flag/enum to select which implementation to use (use polymorphism instead)
- Test that patches internals of the class under test rather than injecting a substitute
